I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the College of Computer Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology, under the supervisor of Prof. Xinwang Liu. I received my bachelor degree and master degree at NUDT in 2020 and 2022. My current research interests include machine learning and data mining, especially in multi-view learning, clustering, and graph learning. Any questions are welcome to contact me by suyuanliu@nudt.edu.cn.
